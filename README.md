# pan_gen
Overview
This program generates a random PAN (Permanent Account Number) card number based on user input. The PAN number consists of a combination of alphabets and numbers in a specific format. The purpose of this program is to simulate the generation of a PAN card number for an individual or an organization.

Structure of the PAN Number
The PAN number generated follows this structure:

The first 3 characters are randomly chosen alphabets.
The 4th character is derived from the purpose of the PAN card (e.g., 'P' for personal/individual).
The 5th character is the first letter of the name provided by the user.
The next 4 characters are randomly generated digits.
The last character is a randomly chosen alphabet.
Notes
Ensure that the purpose entered is either "INDIVIDUAL" for personal PAN card generation.
The program currently does not handle invalid input gracefully and assumes the input is always valid.
Conclusion
This simple program demonstrates how to generate a random PAN card number based on user input, following a specific format. This can be further extended or modified as per specific requirements.
